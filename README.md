# 🧠 Agentic Showcase – Level 4 & Level 5 AI Agents

This repository demonstrates my ability to design, build, and deploy fully modular agentic AI systems aligned with Talent Performer's architecture and philosophy.

It includes:

- ✅ 3 Level 4 Agents — multi-agent teams with reasoning, memory, and tool use
- 🚀 1 Level 5 Agent — stateful agentic workflow with deterministic orchestration

All agents are real-world client-facing solutions, emphasizing reasoning quality, autonomy, and production-ready architecture.
