Clause 9:
Liability   
The Service Provider shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising out

This clause is risky because it limits the liability of the Service Provider for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages. These types of damages can often be significant and can result in financial losses for the client. By including this clause, the Service Provider is essentially absolving themselves of responsibility for any damages that may occur as a result of their services. This could potentially leave the client vulnerable and without recourse in the event of a dispute or issue arising from the services provided.
